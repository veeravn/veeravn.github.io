About Me
--------

Hello! My name is **Veerav Naidu**. I am a student at the **University of Southern California.** I am pursuing my **Masters in Computer Science** with an intention of working in the Software industry upon graduation in December 2017. The Computer Science program at USC has been consistently ranked as one of the top programs in USA. USC has offered me an incredible opportunity to learn from many seasoned industry professionals and given me a chance to work with real world tools in simulated settings. I have always had a passion for computers and now, with my strong background in programming, academic expertise and an unquenchable thirst to learn new things everyday, I am excited to start my career in the Software industry.

Projects
--------

### Web Technologies

[](https://github.com/veeravn/congress)

#### Congress Search Website

Designed and developed a **responsive website** featuring congress search API results, using AJAX, JSON & XML technologies with a combination of HTML, CSS, DOM, PHP and JSON. Provided an interface built upon Bootstrap, jQuery UI, and Angular JS to perform congress search. The responsive website was hosted on **AWS**.

#### Web Search Engine

Designed and developed a **web search engine** by crawling the web using crawler4j. Data collected by the crawler is indexed using **Solr** to which additional features like **spell check, auto completion and page rank** scoring were added. All the additional features have been implemented using custom dictionaries built specifically for the downloaded data set to improve the precision and recall of the search results.

[](https://github.com/veeravn/CongressSearchApp)

#### Congress Search App

Developed an **IOS app** to provide information on Legislators, Bills, and Committees using Congress Search API. This project uses an Amazon EC2 instance as a remote server to which an app built using Xcode, IOS Swift App development and Facebook SDK for IOS communicates using AJAX requests.

### Other Projects

[](https://github.com/veeravn/FantasyDrive)

#### Advanced Mobile Devices and Game Consoles

Led a team of 5 to design and develop a **Virtual Reality (VR)** game that includes Unity3D, C\#, and SteamVR to replicate a real environment and simulate a user’s physical presence in this environment. VR is the medium through which emotion is amplified. Gaming is one of the areas in which VR is used. **Fantasy Drive** is the game which enhances the racing experience of the user with VR. The game’s aim is to simulate the remote control car experience in a VR setting. From our game, the audience will gain a real driving experience, which is a perfect practice for driving in the real life.

#### Software Engineering

Led a team of 9 developers to design and build a native **Android Application** to help a person with Diabetes learn how to manage their condition better. Information about a user is collected at the time of registration. Uses input in the form of estimated blood sugar levels, amount of insulin taken, the type and quantity of food eaten per day to calculate when a patient’s blood sugar levels are too high or too low and the reason behind these spikes. Registration is done with **Google Firebase** and user data is managed by **Google Cloud Firestore NOSQL DB**. Uses the **USDA Food Database API** to allow the patient to search for and add food that they have or will eat to be taken into account for their calculations. For those using a **Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)**, the application can connect to your Dexcom account and use the estimated glucose values from your CGM to calculate the optimum blood sugar levels for you.
